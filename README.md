## How It's Made: 
### **Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

In this project, CSS animation and 3D features are used for the navigation bar. When the nav bar is clicked, the content is shifted in 3 dimensions. This effect is created using CSS 3D features combining with JavaScript DOM. Moreover, videos will autoplay only when the mouse hovers on them. The 3D photo booth is created using pure CSS features. 

## Lessons Learned: 
By developing this project, I have learned how to use CSS features to create 3D effect. Combining with JavaScript DOM, CSS 3D features are very useful for developing aesthetics frontend landing page. But there are some obstacles occurring in developing this project. When creating Classic Car Photo Booth using CSS, there are browser compatibility issues such as the CSS designs are different in Chrome and FireFox. Thus, it takes time to create CSS designs which are compatibile with different browsers.
